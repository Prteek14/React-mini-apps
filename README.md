## Vite + React Setup

This project uses Vite for a minimal, fast React setup with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). ESLint is configured for code quality.

Currently, two official React plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

> The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [React Compiler Installation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

For production apps, consider using **TypeScript** with type-aware lint rules. See the [Vite React TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for guidance.
